## New Players

### Where do I start?

If you're looking to join us at club, you don't need anything to start! Just show up and we'll have everything you need. Once you're ready to invest in the game, I recommend starting with your own warband.

### Purchasing a Warband

You have two options for building a warcry warband. By far the easiest is purchasing a **bespoke warcry team**. These boxes contain everything you need to build a balanced 1k point list, and have a strong theme with fun synergies.

You can browse teams available for order at [https://www.warhammer.com/en-US/warcry](https://www.warhammer.com/en-US/warcry). Once you've found one that you like, use the order form pinned in the `#warhammer` channel of the Xepher discord to place an order with the arcade. This will get you a substantial discount over ordering direct from the Warhammer store.

If you're more willing to spend money on crafting a specific team, you can build a **compendium team**. These are teams that use models from Age of Sigmar and Warhammer Underworlds, which means they don't come bundled together in a way that's cohesive or cost-effective for warcry. Sometimes spearheads are good for this, sometimes not so much. If you go this route, feel free to post a question in the discord for more specific advice.

## Matched Play

### Listbuilding

At Xepher we follow the convention of using the optional rules of Bladeborn Fighters, Battle Traits, and Divine Blessings. A quick rundown of list building:

1. Choose a faction.
2. Choose up to three heroes from that faction.
3. Choose any number of fighters from that faction (total fighter+hero count must be between 3 and 15)
4. **[Optional]** Choose bladeborn fighters and heroes. Heroes may be included if they are in the same Grand Alliance. Once you add a Bladeborn hero, their accompanying fighters may be added as well.
5. **[Optional]** Add divine blessings to get your points as close to 1000 as possible.

If your entire warband shares a faction runemark, you can use the Battle Trait for that faction. Otherwise, you must use the battle trait of their shared Grand Alliance instead.

### Guidelines

- Assume your opponent wants 1k matched play style, unless otherwise stated
- Battle traits are allowed
- Bladeborn fighters and Monsters are allowed
- Divine Blessings are allowed

## Narrative Play

### How do I start?

Anyone is welcome to join ongoing narrative play at any time. All you need to do is create a narrative warband roster, [click here to visit warcrier for more details](https://warcrier.net/docs/battles/narrative-play/creating-a-warband-roster). Once you have it ready come to game night and ask your opponent if they'd like to play narrative, most people will be more than happy to play and help guide you through your first aftermath sequence.

### Guidelines

- Take time to craft your roster, paint, and name your models. It's more fun for everyone when everybody is invested in their team!
- Try not to progress for more than twice a week. You can continue to play games with your narrative roster, but don't perform the aftermath sequence on games after your second. This is an effort to keep everyone at roughly the same place.
- If your opponent has a quest battleplan to do, let them do it!
- If you and your opponent both have a quest battleplan to do, roll off to choose.
